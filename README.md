# CS-330

 How do I approach designing software?
    
    What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    
This course has helped me plan my work out for the week and space things out as to avoid burnout. Having two fairly major coding asssignemnt due each week was much more difficult as starting from scratch in the beginning allowed for a MUCH better understanding of my program but this also introduced more work. 
    
    
    
    What design process did you follow for your project work?
    
I would follow the tutorials on openGL alongside some of the walkthroughs provided for the course in the SNHU CS-330 github repo that was linked in module 1. This helped me with my multitasking and debugging as I encountered many errors along my journey to the final project scene. 
    
    
    
    How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

These skills are applicable to any form of programming that I pursue as they are not specific to openGL. 




How do I approach developing programs?
    
    What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    
This project expanded my skills greatly with abstraction. Since I started my project from scratch, I had to layout my files in a way that would make my code modular, re-usable, and much easier to navigate. 
        
        
    
    How did iteration factor into your development?
    
I would layout what needed to be completed for the end goal then break that down into managebale steps to take. One such example would be camera. This would mean I would need to develop all of my camera code then abstract it out towards the end and make the necessary changes for it to work once the abstraction was complete.
    
    
    
    How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

My approach to coding has changed drastically since starting this course. Being more intimate with the code and not using starter code really helped me to understand why things are laid out the way that they are. I could see why professional developers design their code in certain ways to maintain readability, modularity, and reusability.




How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    
    How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    
As mentioned before, my coding habits in general improved tremendously. I had never abstracted a single thing before other than moving all code out of main() as I was taught that very early on. This will apply to every single project that I tackle from here on out. 
    
    
    
    How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    
Seeing how shapes can be created from points actually helped my 3D visual math skills a lot. When I was developing shapes, I would have to imagine within  my head where each point would need to be and my skills for this have increased tenfold. Visualizing that many points within a 3D space was extremely hard for me and of course did not come without many errors at first. But by the end, I could see each point in three dimensional space much better.
